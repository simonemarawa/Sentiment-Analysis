# Sentiment-Analysis
This project aims to analyze the sentiment of user reviews on the Spotify platform.

I will use three popular natural language processing libraries: 

- Vader
- Flair
- Textblob. 

The goal is to identify and quantify the positive, negative, and neutral sentiment of the reviews, and to explore which library provides the most accurate results.
